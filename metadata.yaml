description: "The Story of Mankind was written and illustrated by Dutch-American journalist,\
  \ professor, and author Hendrik Willem van Loon and published in 1921. In 1922,\
  \ it was the first book to be awarded the Newbery Medal for an outstanding contribution\
  \ to children's literature.\nWritten for his children (Hansje and Willem), The Story\
  \ of Mankind tells in brief chapters the history of western civilization beginning\
  \ with primitive man, covering the development of writing, art, and architecture,\
  \ the rise of major religions, and the formation of the modern nation-state. Van\
  \ Loon explains in the book how he selected what and what not to include by subjecting\
  \ all materials to the question: Did the person or event in question perform an\
  \ act without which the entire history of civilization would have been different?\n\
  After the book's first edition, Van Loon published another edition later in the\
  \ 1920s which included an extra essay, called \"After Seven Years\", about the effects\
  \ of World War I. Since Van Loon's death in 1944, The Story of Mankind has been\
  \ added to extensively by his son, Gerrit van Loon. The most recent version by John\
  \ M. Merriman (1999) covers events up to the late 1990s (ISBN 9780871401755).\n\
